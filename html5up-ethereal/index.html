									<h1 class="major">Hello, I am Rajee
									</h1>
									<p>My full name is <strong>Rajeevan Vairamuthu</strong>, and I have a bachelors of Software Engineering from Concordia University (2015-2019). I am grateful for the CO-OP internships I have completed, as they have further catalyzed my enthusiasm for this field of work. Currently, I am searching for my first full time job to help transition me from a full time student! As a student, I spent my leisure time with my family, friends, building an image recognition software gadget, and untiringly re-watching Marvel movies! Haha! </p>

									<h2 class="major">Work Experience</h2>
									<p>    My first internship with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency was as a IMIT Tester. Here, I implemented test strategies and produced test script deliverables by analyzing functional and business requirements. Additionally, I mitigated solutions by discovering defects in the system and analyzed their potential risks. <br /> <br />  My second internship was with NeuroRx Research as a Database Applications Manager. My day to day work would focus on developing features using PHP to improve the company's web based application. Furthermore, I was responsible for supporting the Project Managers by customizing and maintaining the database by writing complex SQL queries. </p> <p> Moreover, I have been working part time at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency while persuing my degree, until my second internship. Similarily with  NeuroRx, I have continued my employment throughout my last year of University, and to this day. </p>

								    <p>Business Purpose: Coupon calculator software for the Assistant Manager of Cinemas Guzzo (Marche Central). It was created using Java, and its main functionality as requested by the client was successfully met to generate all the possible types of coupon combinations once inserted the total cash value of coupons. This automated a tideous and extremely time consuming task for the managers at Cinemas Guzzo, and serves them on their daily basis. </p>
                                    <p> Academic Purpose: An Android mobile application called Briar (available on Google Play Store).
